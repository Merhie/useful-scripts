Any 'patch' contains modifications which I added/fixed based on my own needs.  All of the original code still belongs to the original author(s) cited.  At all costs, I tried to write the patches to continue the flow of the source coding rather than re-write it entirely (which then wouldn't be a patch :) ).  All patches have been tested and verified to be functioning as expected, however, stuff happens ... so drop me a line if something's broken.
